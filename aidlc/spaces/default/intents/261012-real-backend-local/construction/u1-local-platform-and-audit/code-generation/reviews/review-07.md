### Findings

| ID | Severity | Location | Finding | Required action | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R-01 | Major | scripts/db/stack.ts > externalAddresses (defaultStackDeps) and findExposedPorts | The network-exposure check that guards the stack's well-known default keys only probes IPv4 addresses (`entry.family === "IPv4"`). The code summary itself records that the CLI publishes the ports on `0.0.0.0` and `[::]`. A machine with a LAN, ULA or global IPv6 address passes the check while the database, data API and mail catcher are reachable on that address, and `db:start` then reports success without the acknowledgement flag. This weakens the project rule that the start command verifies no non-loopback address answers. | Also enumerate non-internal IPv6 addresses (skip link-local addresses that need a scope id, or probe them with their interface scope) and probe them. Add a unit test with a fake IPv6 address that answers. Alternatively state in the code summary and `--help` that IPv6 is not checked. | Unresolved |
| R-02 | Minor | supabase/migrations/20261013_platform_idempotency.sql > lifecycle_hold_place, lifecycle_hold_release (granted to `authenticated`) | A denied call by any signed-in account commits an audit event whose organization, target type and target id are caller-supplied and never checked against anything. An ordinary user can append unlimited denied events labelled with another organization's id and arbitrary targets. The events cannot be cleaned (append-only) and will show up for that organization's administrators once U2's read policy applies. The actor is not forgeable, so BR3.9 holds. This is the pattern later units will copy. | Record the abuse limit in the design or add a guard to the pattern, such as requiring the organization to exist, or storing denied events for unknown organizations under a fixed scope. Rate-limit denied writes per account if feasible. | Unresolved |
| R-03 | Minor | scripts/verification/privacy-allowlist.json > ignoredPrefixes, secretIgnoredPrefixes | The email, phone and secret content scans skip `aidlc/` and `source-materials/` entirely. BR11.1 only exempts the fictitious fixtures, lock files, generated folders and the allowed-example list. Real personal data in a tracked text file under `source-materials/` (for example Markdown or text notes) is not detected. Only the workbook and data-file extensions are caught there. The code summary lists this as deviation 8 but gives no mitigation. | Narrow the exemption to the specific record sub-folders that need it, or scan `source-materials/` for emails and phone numbers with the fixture allowlist. If the exemption stays, record it as an accepted risk in the design. | Unresolved |
| R-04 | Minor | aidlc/spaces/default/intents/261012-real-backend-local/construction/u1-local-platform-and-audit/code-generation/code-summary.md > Verification results | The test counts, file inventory (177 files) and `tests/database` file counts are U1-time numbers. U2 has since merged and changed `package.json`, `config.toml`, `scripts/db/` and `src/runtime/database/config.ts`, and the current suite differs. The summary says executable results are authoritative, but a reader may take these as current. | Add a dated "as of U1 checkpoint" note to the verification table, or refresh the counts at the next regeneration. | Unresolved |

> R-01 Reviewer note: `scripts/db/stack.ts` still filters `externalAddresses` to `family === "IPv4"`, so IPv6 addresses are never probed although the stack publishes on `[::]`. No change since iteration 1.

> R-02 Reviewer note: `lifecycle_hold_place` and `lifecycle_hold_release` still write denied events with unchecked caller-supplied organization and target values. No change.

> R-03 Reviewer note: `privacy-allowlist.json` still lists `aidlc/` and `source-materials/` in `ignoredPrefixes` and `secretIgnoredPrefixes`. No change.

> R-04 Reviewer note: `code-summary.md` still carries U1-time counts with no "as of" note. No change.

### Validation Tool Results

| Tool | Result | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Re-read of the claimed sources | No change since iteration 1. | All four prior findings remain open. |

### Summary

Nothing in the unit's artifacts or claimed sources changed, so all four prior findings still apply. One Major and three Minor remain open, which is within the READY limit of at most two Major and no Critical.

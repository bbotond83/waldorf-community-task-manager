# AI-DLC State Tracking

## Project Information
- **Project**: Fix finding B4 (U1 review R-10): a custom local database password gives a dead-end message. In scripts/db/local-guard.ts, assertLocalStackPassword throws "The database connection does not use the local stack's default password, so it is not the local stack; nothing was changed." when the connection password is not the Supabase CLI default. Add one sentence to that message saying that db:seed and db:reset work only with the Supabase CLI's default local password, so a stack started with a custom database password cannot be seeded or reset (restart the stack with the default password or use the hosted tooling for that database; keep the sentence short and free of any password or hash). Keep the check itself unchanged. Update the README line in the "Seed, large seed and reset" section (README.md around line 84) with the same hint. Tests: extend the existing guard test in scripts/db/local-guard.test.ts (the one that accepts only the default password) so a refused custom password produces a message containing the hint and still leaks no password or hash. Mark B4 done in aidlc/spaces/default/intents/261012-real-backend-local/follow-ups/minor-findings-plan.md. Source: plan group B4 of that file. Skip Reverse Engineering and the deployment stages (the person already decided that for these fixes).
